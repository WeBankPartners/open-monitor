## Introduction

Prometheus is an open-source monitor-alarm system and time series database (TSDB) developed by SoundCloud. It is an open-source version of the Google BorgMon monitoring system in Go language.

Open-Monitor encapsulates the functionality of Prometheus without intrusion and provides better alarm management and graphic dashboard, as well as interaction with other systems.  

Open-Monitor consists of several components: `Prometheus`, `Alert Manager`, `Monitor`, `Agent_manager`, `Ping_exporter`, `Archive_mysql_tool`.

## System Architecture

The overall architecture diagram is as follows:

## Summary

WeCube monitors, alerts resources and applications through monitoring plugins.

The plugin is based on Prometheus. The upper layer `Monitor` encapsulates the configuration management and chart display of Prometheus. The `Monitor` backend technology is written by Go + Gin + Xorm, and the front-end technology is written by Vue + ECharts.

**Monitor has the following features：**

- Endpoint Management

  The monitor supplies register and de-register endpoint functions. It synchronizes endpoint from CMDB when it connects to CMDB. It supports group management of endpoints and customization of the the alarm configuration.

- Friendly Dashboard

  The monitor supports mainstream monitoring types, including the host, MySQL, Redis, Tomcat, etc.  
   It also supports Prometheus' native `PromQL` query and its metric configuration.
  The dashboard customization is friendly, too.

- Alarm Management

  It provides the persistence and the distribution of Prometheus alert rules, and it also supports the manifestation of un-recovered alarm panels and historical alarms.
  User can customize endpoint alarm configuration, group alert configuration and receiver management of alarms.

## Main Features

- Endpoint Management: register, start and stop functions.
